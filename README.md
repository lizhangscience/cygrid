# Purpose #

`cygrid` allows to resample a number of spectra (or data points) to a regular
grid - a data cube - using any valid astronomical FITS/WCS projection (see
http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/).

The method is a based on serialized convolution with finite gridding kernels.
Currently, only Gaussian (radial-symmetric or elliptical) kernels are provided
(which has the drawback of slight degradation of the effective resolution). The
algorithm has very small memory footprint, allows easy parallelization, and is
very fast.

A detailed description of the algorithm is given in [Winkel, Lenz & Flöer
(2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...591A..12W), which we kindly
ask to be used as reference if you found `cygrid` useful for your research.

# Features #

* Supports any WCS projection system as target.
* Conserves flux.
* Low memory footprint.
* Scales very well on multi-processor/core platforms.

# Installation #

The easiest way to install cygrid is via `pip`:

```
pip install cygrid
```

The installation is also possible from source. Download the tar.gz-file, extract (or clone from GitHub) and simply execute

```
python setup.py install
```

## Dependencies ##

We kept the dependencies as minimal as possible. The following packages are
required:
* `numpy 1.10` or later
* `cython 0.23.4` or later
* `astropy 1.0` or later
(Older versions of these libraries may work, but we didn't test this!)

If you want to run the notebooks yourself, you will also need the Jupyter
server, matplotlib and wcsaxes packages. To run the tests, you'll need HealPy.

Note, for compiling the C-extension, openmp is used for parallelization and
some C++11 language features are necessary. If you use gcc, for example, you
need at least version 4.8 otherwise the setup-script will fail. (If you have
absolutely no possibility to upgrade gcc, older version may work if you replace
`-std=c++11` with `-std=c++0x` in `setup.py`. Thanks to bs538 for pointing this
out.)

For Mac OS, it is required to use gcc-6 in order to install cygrid. We
recommend to simply use the [homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager and then
use `brew install gcc`.

# Usage #

## Minimal example ##

Using `cygrid` is extremely simple. Just define a FITS header (with valid WCS),
define gridding kernel and run the grid function:

```python
from astropy.io import fits
import cygrid

# read-in data
glon, glat, signal = get_data(...)

# define target FITS/WCS header
header = {
    'NAXIS': 3,
    'NAXIS1': 101,
    'NAXIS2': 101,
    'NAXIS3': 1024,
    'CTYPE1': 'GLON-SFL',
    'CTYPE2': 'GLAT-SFL',
    'CDELT1': -0.1,
    'CDELT2': 0.1,
    'CRPIX1': 51,
    'CRPIX2': 51,
    'CRVAL1': 12.345,
    'CRVAL2': 3.14,
    }

# prepare gridder
kernelsize_sigma = 0.2

kernel_type = 'gauss1d'
kernel_params = (kernelsize_sigma, )
kernel_support = 3 * kernelsize_sigma
hpx_maxres = kernelsize_sigma / 2

mygridder = cygrid.WcsGrid(header)
mygridder.set_kernel(
    kernel_type,
    kernel_params,
    kernel_support,
    hpx_maxres
    )

# do the gridding
mygridder.grid(glon, glat, signal)

# query result and store to disk
data_cube = mygridder.get_datacube()
fits.writeto(
    'example.fits',
    header=header, data=data_cube
    )
```

## More use-cases and tutorials ##

Check out the [`ipython notebooks`](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bwinkel/cygrid/blob/master/notebooks/index.ipynb) in the repository for further
examples of how to use `cygrid`. Note that you only view them on the nbviewer
service, and will have to clone the repository or download the notebooks to run
them on your machine.
